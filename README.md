# SYNCware server 
A repository to allow the collaborative development with the team in India.

# What is SYNCware
A platform that allows the connectivity of devices in warehouses with a click of a button. 

The platform has a front-end, that has been initially developed with React. This development uses the components from material-ui.

At the back-end, Django is running. 

Ideally, events from the back-end should trigger python scripts. To run those python scripts, certain information should be sent over, such as IP address of robot, port number and other pertinent data (We will define it eventually).
